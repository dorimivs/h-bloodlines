hist_rollo;Blood of Rollo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_rollo_desc;"This character is descendant of Rollo, baptised Robert and so sometimes numbered Robert I to distinguish him from his descendants, was a Norse nobleman of Norwegian or Danish descent who was founder and first ruler of the Viking principality which soon became known as Normandy. His descendants were the Dukes of Normandy, and following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, kings of England. Norwegian and Icelandic historians identified Rollo instead with Ganger Hrolf, a son of Rognvald Eysteinsson, Earl of M?re, in Western Norway, based on medieval Norwegian and Icelandic sagas. The oldest source of this version is the Latin Historia Norvegiae, written in Norway at the end of the 12th century. This Hrolf fell foul of the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair, and became a Jarl in Normandy. The nickname the Walker, Ganger in Norse, came from being so big that no horse could carry him. The question of Rollo's origins was a matter of heated dispute between Norwegian and Danish historians of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the run-up to Normandy's millennium anniversary in 1911. The Yngling ""Fairhair dynasty"" lineage introduced in Hversu Noregr bygg?ist and the Orkneyinga and Heimskringla sagas suggests a line of Rollo going back to Fornj?t, the primeval king who reigned over Finland and Kvenland. The claimed line leading to Rollo includes Rognvald Eysteinsson, the founder of the Earldom of Orkney.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingalan;Blood of King Alan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingalan_desc;The proud descedant of king Alan I, called the Great, who was the Count of Vannes and Duke of Brittany (dux Brittonium) from 876 until his death in 907. He was probably also the only King of Brittany to hold that title by legitimate grant of the Holy Roman Emperor! De Rohan family claimed its descend from King Alan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingcunedda;Blood of Cunedda;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingcunedda_desc;This character is a proud descendant of a 5th century important early Welsh leader also known as Cunedda Wledig, the progenitor of the royal dynasty of Gwynedd. His genealogy is traced back to Padarn Beisrudd, which literally translates as Paternus of the Scarlet Robe. One traditional interpretation identifies Padarn as a Roman (or Romano-British) official of reasonably high rank who had been placed in command of Votadini troops stationed in the Clackmannanshire region of Scotland in the 380s or earlier by the Emperor Magnus Maximus. Alternatively, he may have been a frontier chieftain who was granted Roman military rank, a practice attested elsewhere along the empire's borders at the time. In all likelihood, Padarn's command in Scotland was assumed after his death by his son, Edern (Latin: Eturnus), and then passed to Edern's son, Cunedda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingcoel;Blood of King Coel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingcoel_desc;This character is a proud descendant of Coel Hen (AD 350–420), known as the Bonedd Gwur y Gogledd, the head of several post-Roman royal families of the Hen Ogledd. His line, collectively called the Coeling, included such noted figures as Urien, king of Rheged, Gwallog, perhaps king of Elmet, the brothers Gwrgi and Peredur, and Clydno Eiddin, king of Eiddin or Edinburgh.He was also considered to be the father-in-law of Cunedda, founder of Gwynedd in North Wales, by his daughter Gwawl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_kingmilesius;Blood of Milesius;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingmilesius_desc;This character is a proud descendant of Milesius (died before 1287 BC). In Irish origin legends, Mil Espaine or Mil Espine (later pseudo-Latinised as Milesius) is the ancestor of the final inhabitants of Ireland, the 'sons of Mil' or Milesians, who represent the vast majority of the Irish Gaels. His father was Bile, son of Breogan. He served as a soldier in Scythia and Egypt, before remembering a prophecy that his descendants would rule Ireland. He set off to the west, getting as far as Iberia where he fought several battles before dying, never seeing Ireland himself. His wife Scota and his uncle Eth, who had spied Ireland from a tower, sailed to Ireland where Eth was killed by the Tuatha Di Danann. When his body was brought back to Iberia, Mil's eight sons and Eth's nine brothers invaded Ireland and defeated the Tuatha Di Danann.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_kingyngvi;Blood of Yngvi-Frey;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingyngvi_desc;This character are the descendant of the Norse Pagan god Yngvi-Frey of Vanaheim. Ynglings were the oldest known Scandinavian dynasty of the semi-legendary royal Swedish clan during the Age of Migrations, with kings such as Eadgils, Onela and Ohthere. They were kindred of the god Frey, and most faithful witnesses to the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_karling;Blood of Charlemagne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_karling_desc;Karolus Magnus, King of the Franks and Imperator Romanorum ruled over a vast, yet fragile Empire. A major architect of this Empire was Pope Leo III, exiled from Rome by the proper Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius V, the Pope went to the court of the Frankish King and persuaded him to wage a Crusade against the Unholy Empire now found in Rome. In order to give legitimacy to the enterprise Leo had Karolus crowned Sacred Roman Emperor and proclaimed the birth of a new Holy Roman Empire! The crusading armies of this new Holy Roman Empire marched on Rome, but in 802 at the battle of Pavia, an allied Roman coalition led by the Mithraic host of Ravenna defeated the Franks and sent them back over the Alps. The Empire of Karolus Magnus remained a fragmented theoretical state, and upon his death it split into many lesser kingdoms paying only lip service to the new Sacral Emperor reigning in Aachen. The main Karling line retained the fiction of their Holy Roman Imperial title, but little power outside the walls of their Sacral capital. The lesser lines of the Pepinid Karlings and Lotharing Karlings ruling over Austrasia and Lotharingia retain vastly more power than their theoretical overlord. The Emperor himself is nothing but a shadow of the great Karolus, with the great nobility of his inexistent Empire bowing before him in public, yet laughing behind his back. A Karling Restoration is the dream of every Sacral Emperor, and even the lesser bloodlines of the Karlings share it... yet such a dream might be beyond the powers of mere mortal men. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_merovingian;Blood of Merovech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_merovingian_desc;The Merovingian Kings of Francia trace their descent from Merovech and Clovis I, the first great Christian King of the Franks. Their Holy Sang Real has ruled over the Franks for hundreds of years, although many of those years were spent as figure-heads, with overpowerful Mayors of the Palace being the actual power of the realm. The Karlings kept the Sang Real on a tight leash, the Merovingian Kings being in truth less than minor aristocrats in their new capital of Paris. Providing little besides overglorified marriage partners for the Karlings and other more powerful dynasties, the Merovingians could have dissapeared into complete irrelevance. Yet this was not to be. Following the great fragmentation of the Karling Empire and The Third Great War of the Princes, an able scion of the Sang Real rose to great power among the feudal nobles of the Holy Roman Empire. His name was Clovis VI and through his marriage to the Karling princess Adelheid, a well-engineered network of alliances, and undisputed martial genious, this later-day Clovis rebuilt a kingdom for his sacred bloodline. Under his descendants, this Sacral Frankish Kingdom became ever more of a theocracy than a feudal state. The Kings of the Sang Real are considered Holy by their subjects and are said to be able to ritually cure sickness by laying on hands. Ever greater belief in their Sacred Mission meant the Merovingians split with Rome establishing their own Gallic Church, based upon the Mystery of the Sang Real and the divine destiny of its heirs. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_capet;Blood of Hugh Capet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_capet_desc;The Capetians trace their descent from Robert the Strong, the first of their line to ascend the throne of Neustria. As Sovereign-Margrave of Neustria, Robert was one of the great feudal lords of the Empire, and following the collapse of Karling power during The First Great War of the Princes, he had himself crowned King. Following his successes in battle against the Vikings, Robert became known as the Strong and he would come to sire a long line of Kings. In spite of his greatness, the dynasty of Neustria now takes its name after Hugh Capet, one of his descendants. This is a result of Hugh's ephemereal elevation as High King of the Franks during his victorious war against the Karling kingdoms. Wielding the Sacred Oriflamme banner of Saint Denis, after having been gifted the banner by his ally, the Merovingian Charibert VIII, the very image of a Warrior King, Hugh led the armies of Neustria to countless victories. Fittingly in 996, Hugh died in battle, surrounded, yet never surrendering, cut down by his own treacherous nobles, even in death still holding on to the sacred Oriflamme banner, and thus ascending into legend. The Kings of Neustria honor his legacy as they go into battle shouting: 'Montjoie! Saint Denis!' their Host following the Sacred Oriflamme to glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_barcelona;Blood of Bello;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_barcelona_desc;The bloodline of Bello, Lord of Carcassonne since 790 until his death in 810, his descendants, the Bellonids ruled over vast lands in Septimania and Catalonia. The Bellonids became hereditary rulers of the short-lived Spanish March, and under Wilfred the Hairy, Lord of Barcelona, the former territories of the March were reorganized into a powerful Principality. The proud symbol of the Bellonids, the Senyera, the golden flag with four red stripes of the House of Barcelona dates back to Wilfred's participation in the failed Spanish Crusade of Karolus the Bold. Following a great victory against the infidels, the wounded Frankish King smeared four bloodied fingers over Wilfred's golden shield thus giving birth to the eternal symbol of the Catalans. The proud Lords of Barcelona carry the Seyera into battle to this day, ready to add their blood to the golden shield of Wilfred!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_vimaraperes;Blood of Vimara Peres;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_vimaraperes_desc;Vimara Peres, Count of Portugal (820 – 873) was a Galician Christian duke of the 9th century in west Iberia. In 868 Count Vimara Peres was named Count of Portugal, after the reconquest of the region north of the Douro river. Later Portuguese historians viewed this event as the earliest milestone in the history of the state of Portugal. He was able to expel the Moors and founded a fortified town under his own name Vimaranis, present day Guimaraes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_anscar;Blood of Anscar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_anscar_desc;The Anscarids or Anscarii or the House of Ivrea were a medieval Frankish dynasty of Burgundian origin which rose to prominence in Italy in the tenth century, even briefly holding the Italian throne. They also ruled the County of Burgundy in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and it was one of their members who first declared himself a franc-compte or free count. By a cadet branch of the counts of Burgundy came the House of Burgundy-Spain which ruled the kingdom of Galicia from 1111 and the Kingdoms of Castile and Leòn from 1126 until 1369.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_kingrurik;Blood of Rurik;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_kingrurik_desc;Rurik, the Varangian Prince of Holmgardr, established a strong Norse state centered around his newly founded capital. One of many Varangian warlords to try their hand at conquest in the East, Rurik's legacy proved to be the most lasting. His heir Ingvar of Holmgardr was acknowledged by the other Varangian Princes as King of Gardariki. His great Varangian host besieged Miklagard on two ocassions in 941 and 944. Not content with his exploits on the Black Sea, Ingvar terrorized the Caspian as well, his Varangians launching a major expedition into Persia and sacking the great city of Arsakia Rhagae. Inspite of his glorious exploits, Ingvar met with an undignified end, as the Drevlyans captured him while attempting to collect tribute. The Drevlyans bent down two birch trees to the ground and tied them to Ingvar's legs, and then they let the trees straighten, thus tearing him apart. His wife Olga extracted merciless revenge, burning their capital of Iskorosten and then salting its very ground, then leveling their other towns so that nothing remained of them, while all Drevlyan men were put to the sword. Rurik's blood lost the High Kingship, but his descendants continued to reign in Holmgardr and elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_tusculum;Blood of Theophylact;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_tusculum_desc;Theophylact (before 864 – 924/925) was a medieval Count of Tusculum who was the effective ruler of Rome from around 905 through to his death in 924. His descendants would control the Papacy for the next 100 years. Several popes and an antipope during the 11th century came from their ranks. They created and perfected the political formula of noble-papacy, wherein the Pope was arranged to be elected only from the ranks of the Roman nobles. Pornocracy, the period of influence by powerful female members of the family also influenced papal history. The counts of Tusculum remained arbiters of Roman politics and religion for more than a century. In addition to the papal influence, they held lay power through consulships and senatorial membership. Traditionally they were pro-Byzantine and anti-German in their political affiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_etichon;Blood of Etichons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_etichon_desc;The Etichonids were an important noble family, probably of Frankish, Burgundian or Visigothic origin, who rose to dominate the region of Alsace in the Early Middle Ages from the seventh to the tenth centuries. Among the descendants of the Etichonids, in the female line were Hugh of Tours and his family, including his daughter Ermengard, who was wife to Lothair I and thus mother to three Carolingian kings. In the tenth century the Etichonids remained powerful in Alsace as counts, but their power was circumscribed significantly by the Ottonians and by the eleventh century, Pope Leo IX seems unaware that his ancestors, the lords (or counts) of Dabo and Eguisheim for the previous half century were in fact the direct descendants of the last Etichonids. Many notable European families trace their lineage to the Etichonids, including the Habsburgs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_welf_desc;The Elder House of Welf was a dynasty of European rulers in the 9th through 11th centuries to 1055. Its oldest known member was Welf, the first Count of Altdorf. He was mentioned in 819 as father of Empress Judith. The dynasty hold the crown of Burgundy from 888 till 1032. The Elder House of Welf became extinct when Welf, Duke of Carinthia, died childless in 1055. The property of the House of Welf was inherited by the elder branch of the House of Este that came to be known as the younger House of Welf, or House of Welf-Este.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_dulo;Blood of Dulo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_dulo_desc;The House of Dulo was the name of the ruling dynasty of the early Maeotian Alans and subsequently the Hunno-Bulgars. This was the clan of Kubrat who founded Old Great Bulgaria, and his sons Batbayan, Kotrag and Asparuh, the latter of which founded Danube Bulgaria. Hunno-Bulgar legend traces the Dulo clan back to the tribe of a mighty Alan king from which Attila the Hun descended. The Nominalia of the Bulgarian Khans also confirms Attila's descent from the Dulo clan. The Dulo clan name descends from the Tiele tribe group which brought the Onoq out of the Turkic Kaganate. It was ethnic conflict between the Dulo and their Ashina cousins that appears as the main cause that tore apart the Western Turkic Kaganate, bringing about Khazaria, Maeotian Bulgaria, Danube Bulgaria, and Volga Bulgaria. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_bagrationi;Blood of Bagrat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_bagrationi_desc;The Bagrationi dynasty counts among the longest-reigning royal families in the Caucasus (and in Europe). Starting as a princely house and attaining the royal status in both countries in the 9th century. The history of the dynasty is inextricably bound with that of Georgia. They began their rule, in the early 9th century, as presiding princes in historic southwestern Georgia and the adjacent Georgian marchlands reconquered from Arabs. Subsequently they restored, in 888, the Georgian kingdom, which prospered from the 11th to the 13th century, bringing several regional polities under its control. This period of time, particularly the reigns of David IV (1089–1125) and his great granddaughter Tamar (1184–1213), is celebrated as a golden age in the history of Georgia, the era of empire, military exploits, and remarkable achievements in culture. The ancestors of the dynasty traced their descent to the biblical King David, and came from Palestine around 530 AD. Tradition has it that of seven refugee brothers of the Davidic line, three of them settled in Armenia and the other four in Kartli (also known as Iberia by Classical authors), where they intermarried with the local ruling houses and acquired some lands in hereditary possession. One of the four brothers, Guaram (died in 532), allegedly gave an origin to a line subsequently called Bagrationi after his son Bagrat. A successor, Guaram, was installed as a presiding prince of Kartli under the Byzantine protectorate and bestowed, on this occasion, with the Byzantine court title of Kouropalates in 575.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_doukas;Blood of Romans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_doukas_desc;This character is a descendant of the Cives Romani and related to the Doukas family. Doukas is the name of a Byzantine Greek noble family, whose branches provided several notable generals and rulers to the Byzantine Empire. They ruled Byzantium from 1059 to 1081. Later tradition held that they descended from a cousin of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great who had migrated to Constantinople in the 4th century and allegedly became the city's governor with the title of doux. The Komnenoi were related to the Doukas family, whereby the clan often was referred as Komnenodoukai (or Comnenoducae) and both surnames were used together by several individuals. Alexios I married Irene Doukaina, the grandniece of Constantine X Doukas, a general who had succeeded Isaac I in 1059. Several families descended from the Komnenodoukai, such as Palaiologos, Angelos, Vatatzes and Laskaris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_phokas;Blood of the gens Fabia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_phokas_desc;Phokas was the name of a Byzantine aristocratic clan from Cappadocia, which in the 9th and 10th centuries provided a series of high-ranking generals and an emperor, Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969). Its members and their clients monopolized the high command positions of the Byzantine army for much of the 10th century and led the successful Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in the East. According to Michael Attaleiates, the family descended from the ancient Roman gens Fabia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_conradin;Blood of Conradines;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_conradin_desc;The Conradines or Conradiner were a dynasty of Franconian counts and dukes in the 8th to 11th Century, named after Duke Conrad the Elder and his son King Conrad I of Germany. They are related to Geroldonen, their ancestral house, Salian and Udalrichinger dynasties. The family is first mentioned in 832, with Count Gebhard in the lower Lahn region. His sons are mentioned in 861 as propinqui (close relatives) of Adalard the Seneschal, who had served Louis the Pious. But the clan's rise to prominence began with Oda, wife of Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia, who was a member of the family. In view of his family relationship with Oda, Conrad the Elder was frequently referred to as nepos (nephew, grandson, descendant) of the Emperor. He and his brothers apparently were in fact Arnulf's closest relatives, and he relied heavily on their support in his feud with the counts of Babenberg. After Arnulf's death, the Conradines were the only blood relatives of the new king, Louis the Child, and thus the dominant family in the kingdom. Konrad's brother Gebhard became duke of Lorraine in 903. In 906, Conrad the Elder and his son Conrad the Younger decisively defeated the rival counts of Babenberg in the battle of Fritzlar, thereby attaining supremacy in Franconia. Conrad the Elder died in the battle, but his son became duke of Franconia. Five years later, after the death of the last Carolingian wearing the crown of East Francia in 911, Conrad was elected king as Conrad I - instead of the West Francian (and Carolingian) king Charles the Simple, thus ending Carolingian rule in East Francia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_elcid;Blood of El Cid Campeador;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_elcid_desc;This character is a descendant of Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (1043 – July 10, 1099), known as El Cid Campeador. Exiled from the court of the Spanish Emperor Alfonso VI of Leon and Castile, El Cid went on to command a Moorish force consisting of Muladis, Berbers, Arabs and Malians, under Yusuf al-Mutaman ibn Hud, Moorish king of the northeast Al-Andalus city of Zaragoza, and his successor, Al-Mustein II. After the Christian defeat at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086, El Cid was recalled to service by Alfonso VI, and commanded a combined Christian and Moorish army, which he used to create his own fiefdom in the Moorish Mediterranean coastal city of Valencia. Rodrigo Diaz was educated in the royal court of Castile and became the alferez, the chief general, of Alfonso VI, and his most valuable asset in the fight against the Moors. He was the subject of the oldest extant Spanish epic poem Cantar de Mio Cid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_dracula;Blood of Draculesti ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_dracula_desc;The Basarabs were a family which had an important role in the establishing of the Principality of Wallachia, giving the country its first line of Princes. The dynasty was named after Basarab I, who gained the independence of Wallachia from the Kingdom of Hungary. The Draculesti were one of two major rival lines of Wallachian voivodes of the House of Basarab, the other being the Danesti. These lines were in constant contest for the throne from the late fourteenth to the early sixteenth centuries. Descendents of the line of Draculesti would eventually come to dominate the rule of this principality until its unification with Transylvania and Moldavia in 1600. The line of the Draculesti began with Vlad II Dracul, one of the sons of one of the most important rulers of the Basarab dynasty, Mircea cel Batran. The name Draculesti is derived from the membership of Vlad II Dracul, the Dragon, in the Order of the Dragon (founded 1408). One of the sons of Vlad II was Vlad III Draculea, known also simply as Dracula, i.e. son of Dracul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

hist_bathory;Blood of Gut and Kelad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_bathory_desc;This character is a descendant of Gut and Kelad. The Bathory family belonged to the Gutkeled clan of Hungarian nobles, which traced its descent to the Swabian brothers Gut and Kelad, who immigrated into Hungary from the castle Stof during the reign of King Peter (reigned 1038–1046), who himself was partly of Venetian descent. The actual Bathory family began in the 13th century with Andrew of Rakomaz, surnamed the Bald, son of Nikolaus. Andrew is mentioned in 1250 as a patron of the monastery of Sarvar in the county of Szatmar. The most infamous member of the family, Elizabeth, who as a widow was imprisoned for allegedly murdering large numbers of young girls. However given political and judicial processes of the times the facts will never be determined. Some scholars have suggested that she served as one of Bram Stoker's influences for writing the novel Dracula but the evidence to support this is slim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_stewart;Blood of Flaad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_stewart_desc;"This character is a descendant of the Clan Stewart. The Stewart family records its traditional descent from Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, who makes an appearance as a character in William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Historically, however, the family appears to be descended from a mediaeval family who were seneschals of Dol in Brittany, the earliest recorded being Flaad. They acquired lands in England after the Norman conquest, and moved to Scotland with many other Anglo-Norman families when David I ascended to the throne of Scotland. The family was granted extensive estates in Renfrewshire and in East Lothian and the office of High Steward of Scotland was made hereditary in the family. Walter, the son of Alan or Fitz-alan was the founder of the royal family of Stewarts. He was the first of the family to establish himself in Scotland. the Stewarts first became monarchs of the Kingdom of Scotland during the late 14th century, and subsequently held the position of the Kings of England, Ireland, and Great Britain. The dynasty inherited further territory by the 17th century which covered the entire British Isles, including the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland, also maintaining a claim to the Kingdom of France. In total, nine Stewart monarchs ruled just Scotland from 1371 until 1603. After this there was a Union of the Crowns under James VI & I who had become the senior genealogical claimant to The Crown holdings of the extinct House of Tudor. Thus there were six Stewart monarchs who ruled both England and Scotland as well as Ireland. Additionally, at the foundation of the Kingdom of Great Britain after the Acts of Union, which politically united England and Scotland, the first monarch was Anne of Great Britain. During the reign of the Stewarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, fairly modern and centralised state. They ruled during a time in European history of transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. Monarchs such as James IV were known for sponsoring exponents of the Northern Renaissance such as the poet Robert Henryson, and others. After the Stewarts gained control of all of Great Britain, the arts and sciences continued to develop; many of William Shakespeare's best known plays were authored during the Jacobean era, while institutions such as the Royal Society and Royal Mail were established during the reign of Charles II.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_osman_desc;This character is a descendant of Ertugrul, who was the father of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire. He was the leader of the Kayi clan of the Oghuz Turks. The Ottoman Dynasty ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1299 to 1922, beginning with Osman I (not counting his father, Ertugrul), though the dynasty was not proclaimed until Orhan Bey declared himself sultan. Before that the tribe might have been known as Sogut but was renamed Osmanli (Ottoman in English) in honour of Osman. The sultan was the sole and absolute regent, head of state and head of government of the empire, at least officially, though often much power shifted de facto to other officials, especially the Grand Vizier. Mehmed II or Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (March 30, 1432 – May 3, 1481) was the most famous Sultan of the Ottoman Empire for a short time from 1444 to September 1446, and later from February 1451 to 1481. At the age of 21, he conquered Constantinople and brought an end to the Byzantine Empire, absorbing its administrative apparatus into the Ottoman state. Mehmed continued his conquests in Asia, with the Anatolian reunification, and in Europe, as far as Bosnia and Croatia. Mehmed II is regarded as a national hero in Turkey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Amals or Amalings, were the leading dynasty of the Goths, a Germanic people who confronted the Roman Empire in its declining years in the west. According to Gothic legend, the Amali were descended from an ancient hero whose deeds earned him the epithet of Amala or mighty. In the Nibelungenlied and some other medieval German epic poems, the followers of Dietrich von Bern (The Gothic King Theodoric the Great) are referred to as Amelungen. In other cases, Amelung is reinterpreted as the name of one of Dietrich's ancestors. The Kaiserchronik also refers to Dietrich's family as the Amelungen, and in a letter of bishop Meinhard von Bamberg, as well as the Annals of Quedlinburg, Amulungum (the Amelung) is used to refer to Dietrich himself. This shows that the family's legacy was remembered in oral tradition far into the Middle Ages, long after any stories about Amal himself had ceased to circulate. Billungs, Dukes of Saxony, claimed they had descended from Amali. They were also known as Amelungs or von Amlingen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_balti;Blood of Alaric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_balti_desc;This character is a descendant of Baltungs. The Balti dynasty, Balthings, or Balths, existed among the Visigoths, a Germanic tribe who confronted the Western Roman Empire in its declining years. The Balti took their name from the Gothic word balta (bald or bold). It thus meant the Bold ones or Bold men. The Balti were considered next in worth among Gothic fighters, and next in royal dignity, to the Amali. But it was Alaric the Visigoth, a Balth, who led his people to the sacking of Rome in 410 CE and founded a dynasty that would come to rule much of Roman Gaul for a century and all of Roman Hispania for longer, establishing a kingdom in the latter that would last until early in the eighth century. The Balti dynasty of Visigothic kings reigned from 395 to 531. The lords of Baux, near Arles, and of seventy-nine subordinate places, were independent of the counts of Provence, might be a branch of that family, according to Edward Gibbon in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_solomon_desc;"This character is a descendant of Solomon, according to the Book of Kings and the Book of Chronicles, a King of Israel and according to the Talmud one of the 48 prophets, is identified as the son of David, also called Jedidiah, and is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, and the final king before the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah split; following the split his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. In the Quran, he is considered as a major Prophet, known as Sulaiman, son of David. The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are circa 970 to 931 BC. The Solomonic dynasty is the Imperial House of Abyssinia. Its members claim lineal descent from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, the latter of whom tradition asserts gave birth to the first King Menelik I after her Biblically described visit to Solomon in Jerusalem. The dynasty, a bastion of Judaic and later of Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, came to rule Ethiopia in the 10th Century A.D. Precise records of the dynasty's history had been maintained by the Ethiopian Orthodox monasteries to near antiquity.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_vergy;Blood of Erchinoald;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_vergy_desc;This character is a descendant of Erchinoald, mayor of the palace of Neustria in 641. According to Fredegar, he was a relative (consanguineus) of merovingian king Dagobert I's mother. His son, Leudesius, and much of his family were destroyed in the conflict between the factions of Saint Leudegar of Autun Leger and Ebroin in 676, the name does resurface in the 7th century in Frankia suggesting he may have had some descendants who survived and Chaume has posited a sister who was ancestor to a number of powerful families during the Carolingian era such as the Guerinids, the counts of Gatinais, the Guidonids and the Vergy. The House of Vergy is one of the oldest French noble families. The first known lord of Vergy is Guerin (Warin) de Vergy (Saint Warinus), brother of saint Leodegar. Guerin was stoned around 681 at the foot of the rocky spur at Vergy, shortly after his brother's martyrdom. The house of Vergy arose in the 9th century with Warin, or Guerin, I of Vergy(760 – 819), who was count of Chalon and count of M?con, then count of Auvergne (818).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_basil;Blood of Basil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_basil_desc;This character is a descendant of Basil I, called the Macedonian, who was a Byzantine Emperor of probable Armenian descent who reigned from 867 to 886. Born a simple peasant in the Byzantine theme of Macedonia, he rose in the Imperial court, and usurped the Imperial throne from Emperor Michael III. Despite his humble origins, he showed great ability in running the affairs of state, leading a revival of Imperial power and to a renaissance of Byzantine art. He was perceived by the Byzantines as one of their greatest emperors, and the dynasty he founded, the Macedonian, ruled over what is regarded as the most glorious and prosperous era of the Byzantine Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_samo;Blood of Samo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_samo_desc;This character is a descendant of Samo the Great, the First High King and Emperor of the Western Slavs. Samo was not a Slav, but a merchant of Frankish descent. As a supplier of weapons to the Slavs, and as a result of his great personal charisma, Samo came to be elected as High King by the Slavs of Moravia and Slovakia, in their attempt to unite against the Avars. Samo increased his authority over the Western Slavic lands by marrying the daughers of many Slavic princes. He had over twelve wives and fathered twenty two legitimate sons and fifteen daughters by his wives. His progeny by concubines or lovers is myriad! This true father of Western Slavic royalty managed to unite the Western Slavs into their own primitive version of an Empire, a great state that would later come to be called Great Moravia. Humbling all who would oppose him, from the Avars to the Germans and the Franks, Samo crowned himself Emperor in immitation of the Romans, and proved to be an inspiration for many later Slavic monarchs, in truth most descending from him, if only on the maternal side. His descendants squandered his legacy and lost their 'Empire' and thus turned to the worship of Veles in their great bitterness. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_cerdic;Blood of Cerdic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_cerdic_desc;This character is a descendant of Cerdic, the first King of Wessex. The establishment of Wessex started in 495 CE when Cerdic and his son Cynric began to slowly drive out the Brythons from the area that would later become the most famous Kingdom of the Saxons. Claiming descent from Woden himself, the Cerdicing kings of Wessex remained staunchly pagan refusing to convert to Christianity. While the Cerdicing kings consider themselves to be the rightful Bretwaldas of the Saxons, their power has fluctuated over the centuries. Many consider Alfred, Bretwalda of the Saxons to be the greatest of the Cerdicing kings, as a result of his victory in 878 CE over Gutrhum the Danish King of the Danelaw. His defeat of the Danes at Ethandun put an effective end to the expansion of the Danes into Western Britannia. A less fondly rememberd Cerdicing is Edward the Martyr, the one Christian King of Wessex. His repeated attempts at converting his subjects failed miserably and earned him his death in 978 CE, when he was assassinated by his brother the pagan Aethelred, a deed met with great approval by the people. The West Saxons know that they are ruled by the Blood of Woden, and they would never tolerate such blasphemy! The Cerdicings of Wessex remember their divine heritage and uppon their ascension as Kings of the West Saxons are required to swear an Oath to drive the Christians into the Sea. While many Kings have failed this Oath so far, who is to say that a future King of Wessex might not succeed where the others have failed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_arsaces;Blood of Arsaces;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_arsaces_desc;This character is a descendant of Arsaces I of Parthia who, as leader of the Parni tribe, founded it in the mid-3rd century BC when he conquered the Parthia region in Iran's northeast, then a satrapy in rebellion against the Seleucid Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_otton;Blood of Otton;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_otton_desc;This character is a descendant of Liudolf, a Saxon count, son of Graf Brun. The ruling Liudolfing House, also known as the Ottonian dynasty, is named after him - he is its oldest verified member. The Ottonian dynasty was a dynasty of German Kings since 919, named after its first Emperor but also known as the Saxon dynasty after the family's origin. The Ottonian rulers are also regarded as successors of the Frankish Carolingian dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_findlaech;Blood of Findláech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_findlaech_desc;This character is a descendant of Findláech mac Ruaidrí, King of Moray and Fortriu. Findláech, King of Moray managed to become King of Fortriu and after several campaigns throughout the North he was acknowledged as High King of Alba. His rule was ephemereal, as he died at the hands of his own son Mac Bethad, Ri Deircc - the Red King. Mac Bethad would in turn become High King of Alba after assassinating all those who would oppose him. Widely accused of using witchcraft in order to further his ambitions, Mac Bethad openly took the title of The Witch King of Fortriu. Several lesser kings are said to have died as a result of his witchery, and even Duncan, the King of Alba is said to have succumbed to his unholy powers. Being true to his blood, his son Mac Bethad II assassinated his own father, also taking to the title of Witch King of Fortriu with relish. While the Blood of Findláech might have lost the High Kingship, their terrible reputation and fearful powers might very well help restore them to their rightful throne. Their enemies know that to defy them is to court death, for the evils the Blood of Findláech can unleash upon their enemies are legion! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_ivar;Blood of Ivar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_ivar_desc;This character is a descendant of Ivar the Boneless, son of Ragnar Lodbrok. Ivar, the Scourge of the Islands, was one of the leaders of the Norse attacks in Britannia in the middle of the 9th century CE. Ivar campaigned throughout the Islands humbling many kings from the petty Kings of Hibernia to great Kings such as Aella the High King of Northanhymbra. His legendary cruelty saw many captured Kings blood-eagled - their ribs cut off by the spine, then broken on their back, so as to resemble blood-stained wings, their lungs pulled out through the wounds in their back - in order to subdue the rest. The pale skinned Ivar became a figure of great dread and his strange sickness made many whisper of his unnatural condition. It is said that his very bones melted in the end, yet his body would not decay. While some believe that his uncorrupt body was burned in a great pyre, others believe that Ivar was sent to the bottom of the Sea and will one day rise up again to terrorize all of the Islands! His Blood remains strong, and many kings, from Bernicia, to the Isles to Dubhlin, hail Ivar as their legendary sire. They all know that their Blood carries great power, and they all hear the whispers of their great ancestor! None of the Ivarrings believe him to be gone forever, and all await his return from the Sea! Woe to the Lands of Man, when Ivar the Boneless will come again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_fergus;Blood of Fergus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_fergus_desc;This character is a descendant of Fergus Mor, the legendary Progenitor of the Gabrains of Dal Riata. The Eastern line of the Gabrains centered their power around their great stronghold of Dun Chailleann, later called Dunkeld. While their Western relatives claim to be the senior line of the family, the Eastern Gabrains care little for this claim. Their power is greater, and the number of swords they command can do the talking for them! These Gabrains of Dun Chailleann as they have come to be called have held the High Kingship of Alba more times than the Western line in recent times and can safely claim to be the strongest descendants of the Blood of Fergus! While their power has diminished of late, the true Kings of Alba have the resources to humble all of the North, including their wayward Western cousins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_guthrum;Blood of Guthrum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_guthrum_desc;This character is a descendant of Guthrum, the great Danish King of the Danelaw. Guthrum's dream of a great kingdom of Daneland began by humbling the lesser Danish Lords of the East. By 874 CE he had consolidated his power over much of the Danelaw and declared himself as High King of the Danes in England. His campaigns of conquest took him further and further afield, till finally he met the host of Wessex. In 878 CE at Ethandun, Alfred of Wessex defeated in Guthrum in a contest that would become the inspiration of many a song. While Alfred defeated Guthrum, his power was by no means broken, and a treaty was signed between the Danes and the Saxons, with the Great King of the Danelaw holding on to his Eastern dominions. Guthrum's later conversion to Christianity was a calculated move aimed at securing his possessions, a move which proved highly succesful, as the Christian Saxon kings surrounding his lands could stomach a Christian Danish kingdom easier than a pagan one. His Blood still rule over the great Kingdom of Daneland, although they have yet to immitate their great ancestor. While their glory might only be heard in song, they are ever ready to grasp it once more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_halfdan;Blood of Halfdan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_halfdan_desc;This character is a descendant of Halfdan Ragnarsson, the great Norse King of Yorvik. The lesser known son of Ragnar Lodbrok, Halfdan was one of the commanders of the Great Norse Army that ravaged the British Isles in the 9th century CE. While his brothers hogged the glory, Halfdan saw to his conquests. He humbled many Saxon Kings, including Alfred in a great battle near Reading. His rule had many ups and downs and saw him in control of many great cities, including Londinium, before losing them to his many enemies. Widely feared for his cruelty, and reportedly putting even his brother Ivar to shame on that account, Halfdan lost his many domains, and would only manage to hold on to Jorvik. His blood have held on to this great Norse Kingdom ever since and to this day remain the terror of the Isles. Their Raven Banners set fear in the hearts of their enemies, for all who oppose them know that when the Ravens come calling, the Blood Eagles spread throughout the Land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_conan;Blood of Conan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hist_conan_desc;This character is a descendant of Conan Meriadoc, a legendary British leader credited with founding Brittany. Welsh texts associate him with Maxsen Wledic or Magnus Maximus, a Roman usurper of the Valentinian dynasty who was widely regarded as having deprived Britain of its defenses when he took its legions to claim the imperial throne. De Rohan family claimed its descent from Conan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hist_huosi_desc;The Huosi were one of the Uradel noble families in the stem duchy of Bavaria during the reign of the Agilolfing dynasty, mentioned in the 743 Lex Baiuvariorum. An affiliation with the later Luitpolding dynasty is possible but not proven. The desendance of the East Frankish Luitpoldings has not been conclusively established. The progenitor of the family Margrave Luitpold of Bavaria possibly was a relative of the Early medieval Huosi noble family. An affiliation with the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach is possible though not proven, Count palatine Arnulf II about 940 had a castle built at Scheyern, the descendants of Count Otto I of Scheyern, documented as Vogt of Freising in 1047, are rated as ancestors of the Wittelsbachs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
